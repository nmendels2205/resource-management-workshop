# Resource Management Deep Dive Lab

Welcome to the Resource Management Deep Dive Lab! In this exercise, you will troubleshoot and fix several applications that are not optimized. Each application is located in its respective folder, numbered **eggclicker**, **primefactors**, **primefactorsv2**, and **logaggregate**.
