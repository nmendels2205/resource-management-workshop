# Resource Management Workshop

Welcome to the **Resource Management Workshop**! In this workshop, youâ€™ll gain hands-on experience with OpenShift resource management concepts and tools. Youâ€™ll explore the importance of resource allocation, discover how to manage resources in multi-tenant environments, and learn optimization techniques to ensure efficient resource utilization.

---

## Workshop Overview

This workshop consists of three labs, each focusing on a specific aspect of resource management:

### **Lab 01: Resource Management Deep Dive**
- **Objective**: Understand the importance of correct resource allocation and its impact on cluster performance.
- **What You'll Learn**:
  - The risks of overcommitment and underutilization.
  - How to analyze and address resource allocation issues.

---

### **Lab 02: Multi-Tenant Resource Management**
- **Objective**: Learn how administrators can ensure fair resource sharing across multiple tenants.
- **What You'll Learn**:
  - Configuring and enforcing `ResourceQuota` and `LimitRange` for namespaces.
  - Using `ClusterResourceQuota` for global resource management in multi-tenant clusters.

---

### **Lab 03: Resource Management Optimizations**
- **Objective**: Explore advanced tools and methodologies to optimize resource allocation.
- **What You'll Learn**:
  - Analyzing resource usage with OpenShift monitoring tools.
  - Leveraging Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA)
  - Implementing resource profiling to fine-tune application configurations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following:
1. Access to a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster with admin privileges.
2. Familiarity with Kubernetes basics, such as Pods, Deployments, and Services.
3. OpenShift CLI (`oc`) or Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`) installed and configured.
   - **OpenShift CLI**: [Download Here](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/)

4. A text editor or IDE to review and modify YAML manifests.

## How to Use This Repository

Each lab is located in a separate folder:
- `01-resource-management-deep-dive/`
- `02-multi-tenant-resource-management/`
- `03-resource-management-optimizations/`

Navigate to the corresponding folder to start the lab. Each lab folder contains:
- A `README.md` file with step-by-step instructions.
- YAML manifests and additional scripts to complete the lab.

### General Steps to Run a Lab
1. Follow the instructions in the labâ€™s `README.md`.
2. Apply the provided YAML files using the `oc apply -f`
3. Review the outcomes and analyze the results using the clusterâ€™s dashboard or CLI tools.

## Workshop Goals

By the end of this workshop, you will:
- Understand the critical role of resource management in OpenShift.
- Be equipped with tools and strategies to manage resources in multi-tenant environments.
- Optimize resource usage to improve application performance and cluster efficiency.
